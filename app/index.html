              <p>Herdade da Matinha is a small, family-run boutique hotel and it's our absolute favourite place to visit. It’s located about 2 hours south of Lisbon, close to the rugged and beautiful Atlantic coast.</p>

              <div class='subheader bold push-down'>how do I get there?</div>
              <p>HdM can only be reached by car so please follow the directions carefully and keep your eyes out for the signposts as you approach the hotel driveway.</p>

              <p>Herdade da Matinha, Cercal, 7555-231, Portugal</p>

              <div class='subheader bold push-down'>what to wear?</div>
              <p>Friday night: Smart casual<br>
              Saturday night: Summer cocktail (dresses for girls, jackets for boys)<br>
              <em>It can get cooler in the evening, so please bring something to cover up</em></p>

              <div class='subheader bold push-down'>driving directions</div>
              <p><em>To Cercal</em>:<br>
              From central Lisbon, follow local directions to the IP7 motorway, and cross over the Ponte 25 de Abril bridge. Stay on the IP7, and continue south as the motorway becomes the A2. Around 120km south of Lisbon, take exit 10 from the A2, signposted for IP8 (Beja). After the toll booth, look for signs for the N262 to Algarve/Ourique and take this road. Remain on the N262 for around 55km until you enter the town of Cercal.</p>

              <p>The motorway toll for the journey is around €10.</p>

              <p><em>Continuing on to Herdade da Matinha</em>:<br>
              At the center of Cercal you’ll find a large roundabout. To drive to Herdade, follow the signs for Rua 25 de Abril (N390), which is the second exit if you are coming into Cercal from Lisbon. Follow this road for just under 2kms out of town, and keep your eyes open for a signpost for “Herdade da Matinha” on the right hand side of the road. Take this turn off, and follow the track straight for around 3km until you reach the hotel and parking.</p>

                  Lisbon airport is very close to the city and a taxi to the center will cost about €15.  There is also an efficient Metro system that connects out to the airport.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Lisbon is a great walking town and we recommend following the route of the 28 tram past the Cathedral to the monastery, and through Barrio Alto to Chaido. The tram is a cheap and fun way to get around, and taxis are very affordable
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  For dinner on Thursday night, we recommend <a href='http://www.1300taberna.com'>1300 Taberna</a>, <a href='http://thedecadente.pt/'>Decadente</a>; reservations are essential at either place. For something more casual, <a href='http://pizzeriacasanova.pai.pt/'>Casanova</a> has great pizzas down by the water.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  We hope you will join us from 10pm at Park Bar for drinks and dancing. The bar is on the roof of the car park, located at Calcada do Combro 58. Take the lift to the 6th floor, climb the final flight of stairs and you’ll see the entrance to the bar.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  If you want to go out late, the <a href='http://www.luxfragil.com/'>Lux club</a> has a great DJ line-up, is part owned by John Malkovich, and stays open until the sun rises.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  To get to Cercal on Friday, it’s best to hire a car or car pool with others as there isn’t any public transport. All major car rental companies have locations at the airport and in central Lisbon. There is plenty of parking available at the wedding venue and each hotel.

                  A stunning stretch of sand featuring amazing surfing and swimming in the Atlantic
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Taking the road from Cercal to Milfontes, turn right at the first roundabout in Brunheiras. Follow this road for 2.5km, and drive straight on when the road curves 90degrees to the right. Follow the sandy track, past a campsite and down the hill to the cliff top parking. The walk down to the beach is steep and sandy - take care, especially with children
                  </p>

                  <b>Porto Covo</b>
                  <p>
                  A lovely fishing village with a square with numerous terraces. Look out for the Miramar seafood restaurant right in the village, as well as the Ilha Pessegueiro on the road to the south, which is a great place to stop for a beer

                  <b>Ribeira da Azenha</b>
                  <p>
                  Between Praia Malhao and Porto Covo, you will find the this beautiful town beach with its thousands of round pebbles. Excellent for surfing, and the beach can be accessed easily on foot
                  </p>

                  <b>Church and Castle</b>

                  Walk through the historic center and visit the church and the 16th century castle fortress
                  </p>

                  <b>Fishermen Trail</b>
                  <p>
                  Walk a small section of the Rota Vicentina. Heading north from the town, you can walk for several hours.
                  </p>

                  <b>Choupana</b>
                  <p>
